# Python Dictionaries

## Introduction
A Python dictionary is an unordered collection of data values used to store data values like a map. Unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, a dictionary enables us to store key:value pairs. The dictionary holds a pair of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value. Dictionaries are mutable, which means they can be changed.

## Practical Tasks
Here are 25 tasks that you can practice to improve your knowledge and understanding of Python dictionaries:

1. Create a dictionary with a different data type as key and value.
2. Update the value of a specific key in a dictionary.
3. Print all the keys in a dictionary.
4. Print all the values in a dictionary.
5. Write a Python script to concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one:

```python
dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50, 6:60}
```

6. Write a Python script to check if a given key already exists in a dictionary.
7. Write a Python program to iterate over dictionaries using for loops.
8. Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x).
9. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a dictionary.
10. Write a Python program to multiply all the items in a dictionary.
11. Write a Python program to remove a key from a dictionary.
12. Write a Python program to map two lists into a dictionary.
13. Write a Python program to sort a dictionary by key.
14. Write a Python program to get the maximum and minimum value in a dictionary.
15. Write a Python program to get a dictionary from an object's fields.
16. Write a Python program to remove duplicates from Dictionary.
17. Write a Python program to check a dictionary is empty or not.
18. Write a Python program to combine two dictionary adding values for common keys.
19. Write a Python program to print all unique values in a dictionary.
20. Write a Python program to create and display all combinations of letters, selecting each letter from a different key in a dictionary.
21. Write a Python program to create a dictionary from a string.
22. Write a Python program to print a dictionary line by line.
23. Write a Python program to check multiple keys exists in a dictionary.
24. Write a Python program to count the values associated with key in a dictionary.
25. Write a Python program to sort Counter object by value.
